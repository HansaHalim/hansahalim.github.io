                        <p>
                            This project is an MLH Hackathon Winner for Best Internet of Things Category in StarterHacks 2019. We made a virtual queue system where people can line up for a service without having to be physically present. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The app was coded in Java and XML using Android Studio. I integrated the app with Google's Firebase Real Time Database to store vital information about the queue. In addition I also implemented the QR code mechanism between the business and the client using the ZXing library. I was the Lead Developer for this project with 3 other people.

                        <p>
                            This game is just like Tetris, but it is static and multiplayer! The game was created as part of a CS246 Final project which received a final mark of 97. X11 forwarding was used to draw the graphical display of this game. We incorporated Object-Oriented Programming principles such as abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation and a number of design pattern such as decorator, factory, model-view controller. The entire code was written in C++ in a team of 3 people using Github.

                            This simple to play game was made using Adobe Animate that allows me to use its Flash functionality to run this game. I created this game in inspiration of <em>Flappy Bird</em> who went viral in a few days of its release. The Player will navigate the SpaceShip using keyboard arrows and guide it to avoid obstables. Each time an obstacle is avoided, a point is awarded.

The project itself generated a total revenue exceeding Rp. 20,000,000 (CAD$2000) and a total of 6000 unique players worldwide! The server used for this project was located in Singapore on a VPS using Intel i5 with 4.5 GB of RAM.

                            Playing chess and want to know if you are losing? I made a checkmate checker where you can have 1, 2 or as many queens as the chess board allows. Usually when we play chess, it is hard to determine whether you have any possible moves left as a single king, which is why this program comes in helpful.

                        <p>
                            I wrote a maze solver that can solve a maze using right-hand rule wall follower algortithm. The image on the right is a maze question and the solution is given on it. The image on the left is a machine readable code for the maze. The solver then uses the wall follower algorithm to find the solution to this maze. The solution is then shown where U - Up, D - Down, R - Right, L - Left from our point of view. By following the solution set, it will lead you from the start line to the finish line.

The game rules are simple and this program demonstrates the game using black and white boxes provided by the XWindows library.
